# Design Choices

The website was designed in a way to mirror other websites users might be accustomed to, having a defining Logo at the top of each page and a Navbar with a familiar layout to may other sites will help users navigate the page from their first visit. This is consistant across all 4 pages to ensure ease of use and support the user exploring the site in full. The same design thought was used in creting the footer, ensure consistancy and promote familiarity with the site.

## Colour

For the colour-wheel I chose an earthy pallet that will hopefully link the user with outdoors and being active. The colours were chosen with the use of Adobe Color which helped choosegit  supporting colours.

## Fonts

Quicksand was used for H1 and H2 headings with Roboto used for all other text.

# Features

The logo featured in the top left of brower pages and centrally on mobile and table sizes. It is also prominent on all 4 pages so the user sees consistancy throughout the site. while the navbar Featured in the top right of brower pages and centrally on mobile and table sizes just under the logo, this will help users navigate the page easily without the use of the 'back' button.
