# Design Choices

The website was designed in a way to mirror other websites users might be accustomed to, having a defining Logo at the top of each page and a Navbar with a familiar layout to may other sites will help users navigate the page from their first visit. This is consistent across all 4 pages to ensure ease of use and support the user exploring the site in full. The same design thought was used in creating the footer, ensure consistency and promote familiarity with the site.

## Colour

For the colour-wheel I chose an earthy pallet that will hopefully link the user with outdoors and being active. The colours were chosen with the use of Adobe Color which helped choosing supporting colours.

## Fonts

Quicksand was used for H1 and H2 headings with Roboto used for all other text.

# Features

* ## Logo and Navigation Bar

The logo featured in the top left of browser pages and centrally on mobile and table sizes. It is also prominent on all 4 pages so the user sees consistency throughout the site. While the navbar featured in the top right of browser pages and centrally on mobile and table sizes just under the logo, this will help users navigate the page easily without the use of the 'back' button.

* ## Landing page

This image and short intro are designed to provide clarity as to what you can expect from this site.

* ## More info section and 'Click here' buttons

This section is designed to elaborate more on the initial landing page, giving more detail as to what content is on the site. The 'Click here' buttons were added to improve the navigation of the site. Give the user the ability to explore more without having to scroll.

* ## Footer

The footer section houses the social media links that are designed to open in a new browser. The goal of these is link the site with popular traffic drivers and connect rhough social medias.

* ## Timetable with maps

This section will allow the user to see what games are available and at what times. With the map they can also get directions to these locations and routes available.

* ## Gallery

The gallery is a way to provide interest for return visitation. The gallery value would also be to make the page more relatable and add encourage people to get in touch by putting a human element to the website.

This page is to allow users to get in touch if they want to sign up for one of the games, add a game they would like listed or get in touch about getting photos added to the gallery.
